# Getting Started with Create React App
E-COMMERCE example for my portfolio!


## Available Scripts

This e-commerce has been made to show some basic implementations of :

- React
- Styled-components 
- Firebase
- Context API

Don't forget to use 'npm install' to make sure all dependencies are OK.
Notice that there are three environment variables that you should replace with your own Firebase credentials, with access to de corresponding database.
